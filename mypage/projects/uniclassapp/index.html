                There's a clear representation of the information the user needs to know. When does the class start, when
                does it end, and they can sign to that class by clicking on the check box ( which in this case is a circle ).

                get notification for each class, depending on that when they start, etc. In the menu, there's also links to the

            UgdApp is a mobile application that helps students by notifying them about their subjects.
            This is actually an application me and my brother are developing. We took part in a Hackathon organized by the University I study at, where we won the first place with this idea.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea is to present the information visually better to the students and also allow them to know wether they have class soon or not. If they're connected to the internet ofcourse, and will decide itself if it should notify them by sending them a notificaton on their smartphone, or not.
            This depends on a few things. Is the student subscribed to the subject? Is the student in radius greater than 3km (1.8 miles) from the campus? Does the class start in less than 30 minutes? If both conditions are met,
            the student will get a notification.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is for students. But what about professors? <br/>
            This will allow the professors to notify their students in case they won't make it to class, or if the class is rescheduled. <br/>
            Only students subscribed to the subject the professor is sending a notification for will get the message.
          </p>
          <p>
            My responsibility in this project is to provide stunning UI design, and develop the front-end of the application. Meaning, turn the design into an interractive application which the users interract with.
